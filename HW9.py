# START OF HOMEWORK Questions
# 1. Create a method called add_product_to_customer_cart that takes in a Customer object and a Product object. The method should add the product to the customer's cart. The method should also print out the product that was added and the customer's name.
# Hint: You can use the add_to_cart method from the Customer class.
# Hint2: This method does not need to be in a class. It should be a regular function that takes in a Customer object and a Product object.
def add_product_to_customer_cart(customer: Customer, product: Product):
    customer.add_to_cart(product)
    print(f"{product} was added to {customer.name}'s cart")

# 2. Create a method called remove_product_from_customer_cart that takes in a Customer object and a Product object. The method should remove the product from the customer's cart. The method should also print out the product that was removed and the customer's name.
# Hint: You can use the remove_from_cart method from the Customer class.
# Hint2: This method does not need to be in a class. It should be a regular function that takes in a Customer object and a Product object.
def remove_product_from_customer_cart(customer: Customer, product: Product):
    customer.remove_from_cart(product)
    print(f"{product} was removed from {customer.name}'s cart")


# 3. Create a menu function that will display the following menu:
# 1. Add Product
# 2. Add Customer
# 3. Add Product to Customer's Cart
# 4. Remove Product from Customer's Cart
# 5. Display Products
# 6. Display Customers
# 7. Display Customer's Cart
# 8. Checkout
# 9. Exit
def menu():
    while True:
        try:
            print("1. Add Product")
            print("2. Add Customer")
            print("3. Add Product to Customer's Cart")
            print("4. Remove Product from Customer's Cart")
            print("5. Display Products")
            print("6. Display Customers")
            print("7. Display Customer's Cart")
            print("8. Checkout")
            print("9. Exit")
            choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))
            return choice
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid choice. Please enter a valid integer.")



# The menu function should return the user's choice as an integer.
# Hint: Print out the menu and then use the input() function to get the user's choice.

# 4. Create a main function that will call the menu function and then call the appropriate methods based on the user's choice. The main function should be in a while loop that will continue to call the menu function until the user enters 0 to exit the program.
# IMPORTANT: The main function should create a Store object and then call the appropriate methods on the Store object. Without the Store object, you will not be able to add products or customers.
# IE main function should look something like this:
# def main():
#     store = Store()
#     while True:
#         choice = menu()
#         if choice == 1:
#             # call add_product method
#         elif choice == 2:
#             # call add_customer method
#         elif choice == 3:
#             # call add_product_to_customer_cart method
# ETC...

# Hint 1: If you need informtation from the user about a product or customer, you can ask for it in the main function and then pass it to the appropriate method. Don't be afraid to use input() in the main function.
# Hint 2: Some of the methods take in a Product object or a Customer object. You will need to create a Product object or a Customer object before calling the method. You can create a Product object or a Customer object in the main function and then pass it to the appropriate method.
# Hint 3: You can use the display_products and display_customers methods to help you out.
# Hint 4: Some Methods take in parameters. You will need to pass in the correct parameters to the method. For example, the add_product method takes in a Product object. You will need to pass in a Product object to the method. You can pass in a Product as a parameter.
# IE. store.add_product(product) where product is a Product object.
# store.add_product(Product(name, price, product_id))
# You can either ask the user for the name, price, and product_id or you can hard code it in the main function.
