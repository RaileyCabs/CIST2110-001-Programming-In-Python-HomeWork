# This homework will exapnd upon the code for Lab9.py. If you did not complete Lab9.py, you should do so before attempting this homework.

# Copy the code from Lab9.py into this file. I'll add some comments to help you out.


# Import statements (activate venv and install streamlit if you haven't already)
import streamlit as st
import datetime as dt

# Streamlit title, subtitle, date, and button

# START OF HOMEWORK Questions

# 1. Create a function calculate_days_until_birthday that will calculate how many days from now until the user's birthday.
# The function should take in the user's birthday as a parameter and return the number of days until their birthday. 
# The function should also display the number of days until their birthday in the Streamlit app. 
# The function should be called in the app function.
def calculate_days_until_birthday(birthday: dt.date) -> int:
    current_date = dt.datetime.now().date()
    days_difference = (birthday - current_date).days
    return days_difference

# 2. Create a function days_until_semester_ends that will calculate how many days from now until the end of the semester.
#  The function should take in the current date as a parameter and return the number of days until the end of the semester.
#  The function should also display the number of days until the end of the semester in the Streamlit app. 
# The function should be called in the app function.
# Hint: You can use the date object to create a date for the end of the semester. IE.
# end_of_semester = dt.date(2023, 12, 8)

def days_until_semester_ends(current_date: dt.date) -> int:
    end_of_semester = dt.date(2023, 12, 8)
    days_difference = (end_of_semester - current_date).days
    return days_difference
# 3. Create a function days_until_new_years that will calculate how many days from now until New Year's Day. The function should take in the current date as a parameter and return the number 
# of days until New Year's Day. The function should also display the number of days until New Year's Day in the Streamlit app. 
# The function should be called in the app function. Also includean emoji of a party popper in the Streamlit app.
# Hint: You can use the date object to create a date for New Years. IE. 
# new_years = dt.date(2024, 1, 1)
# Hint: To add an emoji, use the st.write() function. IE. st.write("ðŸŽ‰")
def days_until_new_years(current_date: dt.date) -> int:
    new_years = dt.date(2024, 1, 1)
    days_difference = (new_years - current_date).days
    return days_difference

# 4. create a button that will display the number of days until New Year's Day when clicked. The button should be labeled "Days until New Year's Day".
#  The button should call the days_until_new_years function when clicked.
#  The button should be placed below the "Calculate" button.Inside the app function call the days_until_new_years function when the button is clicked.

# Hint: You can use the st.button() function. IE. button = st.button("Click me")
# Hint2: the days_until_new_years function takes in the current date as a parameter. You can use the dt.datetime.now().date() function to get the current date. 
# IE. current_date = dt.datetime.now().date()
# Hint3: You can use the days_until_new_years function to get the number of days until New Year's Day. IE. days_until_new_years(current_date) This is where you include the emoji  ðŸŽ‰
