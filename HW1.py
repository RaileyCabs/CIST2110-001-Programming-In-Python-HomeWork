# 2 + 2

# 3 * 4

# 5 - 6

# 8 / 2

# Question 5:
# Create a variable called "num1" and set it equal to 2

# Create a variable called "num2" and set it equal to 3

# Create a variable called "num3" and set it equal to 4

# Create a variable called "num4" and set it equal to 5

# Calculate the following and print the result:
# num1 + num2

# num3 * num4

# num4 - num1

# num2 / num1

# Question 6: Write a program that asks the user for their name and then prints the following:

# Hello, <name>. Please enter three numbers.

# The program should then ask the user for three numbers (floats) and print the following:


# 1. The sum of the three numbers is <sum>

# 2. The product of the three numbers is <product>

# 3. round the three numbers to the nearest integer and print the sum of the three rounded numbers divided by 3 

# 4. The average of the three numbers is <average>

# Question 7: Ask the user for an input of a symbol (in the example its *)     
# Print a diamond of the symbol that looks like the following. Include the spaces and the | character. 
# Hint: the print("symbol", end="") with \t and \n characters will be useful here.

#    *     |
#   ***    |
#  *****   |
# *******  |
#  *****   |
#   ***    |
