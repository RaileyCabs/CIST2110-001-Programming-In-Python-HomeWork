# This homework assignment tests on list in python

# Question 1: Create a list with 5 of your favorite foods. Print the list
foodies = ["pizza", "adobo", "bicol express", "buwad", "ube halaya"]

print(foodies)

# Question 2: Using the list from question 1, print the first and last element of the list
print(foodies[0], foodies[-1])

# Question 3: Using the list from question 1, print the 3rd element of the list
print(foodies[2])
# Question 4: Using the list from question 1, print the 1st through 3rd elements of the list using list slicing
print(foodies[0:3])
# Question 5: Using the list from question 1, print the last 2 elements of the list using list slicing
print(foodies[-2:])
# Question 6: Using the list from question 1, create a for each loop that prints each element of the list
for each in foodies:
    print(each)

# Question 7: Using the list from question 1, create a for loop that prints each element of the list in reverse order
for each in foodies[::-1]:
    print(each)

# Question 8: Using the list from question 1, create a for loop that prints each element of the list and its index (hint use the enumerate() function)
for index, item in enumerate(foodies):
    print(index, item)

# Question 9: Using this list of lists, print the first element of the second list (hint: use indexing)
list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
print(list[1][0])

# Question 10: Create a function that will take in a list and return the list in reverse order
# Hint: You can take in a list as a parameter and return a list

def reverse_list(list):
    return list[::-1]
